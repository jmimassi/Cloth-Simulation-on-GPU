# Cloth Simulation on GPU using Rust and WGSL

## Description

This project aims to simulate the behavior of a cloth falling on a sphere using Rust programming language and WGSL (WebGPU Shading Language). The simulation will be executed on the GPU, leveraging its parallel processing capabilities for efficient computation.
